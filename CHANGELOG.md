### Added
- Introduced Chapter 7 “Non-Functional Requirements” with atomic NFR-REQ-01 through NFR-REQ-07 aligned to DESIGN.md.

### Changed
- Lastenheft now contains functional requirements only; governance, architecture, and LLM rules fully moved to DESIGN.md.
- Standardized UI terminology (“Benutzeroberfläche”) across all frontend requirements.
- Distinguished user-controlled context values from system-controlled runtime states.
- Refined AI metadata responsibility from Backend to System.
- Harmonized wording for analysis_scope, analysis_status, error_state, data_origin, generated_flag, fetched_at, and stock_resolution_status.

### Removed
- Sections 1.4–1.7 (meta, governance, documentation artifacts) from Lastenheft; normative authority relocated to DESIGN.md.
