# SYSTEM REPORT — Stock News Pro
# =============================

⚠️ NON-NORMATIVE / DESCRIPTIVE DOCUMENT

This document is a **System Report**.

It is:

- DESCRIPTIVE
- NON-NORMATIVE
- NON-AUTHORITATIVE
- REGENERATABLE

It MUST NOT define rules, architecture, or constraints.

---

## DOCUMENT ORIGIN

This document is generated by an LLM (e.g. Gemini / Anti-Gravity) based on:

- Current codebase observation
- Runtime behavior
- DESIGN.md constitution

It represents an **observed system state**, not an intended design.

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

The System Report exists to:

- Describe the current technical state of the system.
- Enable audits against DESIGN.md.
- Provide traceability between constitution and implementation.
- Serve as an audit artifact for humans, LLMs, and automated systems.

This document enables:

| Audience | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| LLM | Knows how System Reports must be generated |
| Test System | Validates report structure and compliance |
| Auditor | Distinguishes normative vs descriptive content |
| Human | Understands real system state |
| Governance | Prevents rule dilution |

---

## GOVERNANCE RELATION

Binding Authority:  
→ DESIGN.md ONLY

This document:

- MUST NOT override DESIGN.md  
- MUST NOT reinterpret DESIGN.md  
- MUST NOT introduce new rules  
- MUST NOT resolve deviations implicitly  

Any deviation from DESIGN.md MUST be explicitly marked as:

> **Deviation from DESIGN.md**

---

## DOCUMENT STATUS

- Snapshot in time  
- Not authoritative  
- Safe to discard and regenerate  
- Cannot be used as design source

## DATE

## REPORT TYPE

Technical Architecture Review

---

## SCOPE

Frontend (React / Tauri) & Mock Services

---

# 1. Executive Summary

Stock News Pro is a desktop-native financial analytics dashboard designed to assist investors in analyzing:

- Stock market data  
- Sector news  
- AI-generated reports and essays  

The system prioritizes:

- UI stability  
- Architectural clarity  
- Mock-driven development  
- LLM governance readiness  

---

# 2. System Architecture

## Observed Architecture Style

Component-Based Monolithic SPA.

## Observed Separation of Concerns

| Layer | Observation |
|------|------------|
| UI | React Components |
| State | Context-based |
| Services | MockApiService |
| Desktop | Tauri shell |

## Observed Technology Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript ~5.9
- Vite 7.3
- TailwindCSS 3.4
- Tauri v2
- Recharts 3.6
- Lucide React

## Observed Boundaries

- Backend: Mock only
- AI: Template simulation

---

# 3. Module Overview

Note:  
Detailed module inspection is intentionally omitted in this snapshot.

This report focuses on architectural compliance rather than file-level inspection.

---

# 4. Data Flow Observation

Observed flow:

User Input  
→ Frontend State Update  
→ Mock Service Invocation  
→ Mock Result Generation  
→ UI Render  

This matches the unidirectional data flow rule defined in DESIGN.md.

---

# 5. API Behavior (Mock)

Observed characteristics:

- Async promise-based interface
- Deterministic mock responses
- Fuzzy resolution for stock names
- Synthetic fallback generation

⚠️ **Deviation Risk:**

Mock fallback generation masks missing data.

DESIGN.md requires explicit distinction between:

- Real data
- Generated data

This must be enforced in production.

---

# 6. LLM Simulation Behavior

Observed:

- Static template generation
- Deterministic output
- No real LLM connection

Compliance:

✔ Generated data is identifiable  
✔ No silent overwrite of verified data  

---

# 7. Compliance with DESIGN.md

### Observed Compliance

- Component-based architecture
- Unidirectional data flow
- Mock isolation
- Typed structures
- Frontend/backend decoupling

### Not Yet Implemented (Expected for Prototype)

- Real backend integration
- Typed IPC bridge
- Token governance
- Observability
- Persistent cache

These are roadmap items, not violations.

---

# 8. Risk Summary

| Area | Risk | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Backend | No real backend | Accepted |
| Token Control | Not active | Pending |
| Cache | Lost on reload | Known |
| Error Semantics | Mock hides missing data | Must fix |
| IPC | Not implemented | Pending |

---

# 9. Architectural Readiness

Ready for:

- UI development
- Architecture validation
- Mock demos

Not ready for:

- Production deployment
- Real market data
- Real LLM integration

---

# 10. Final Assessment

Internal consistency: YES  
Extensibility: YES  
Production readiness: NO  

**Verdict:**

Stock News Pro is a professionally structured prototype with a clean architectural foundation.  
The React/Tauri migration provides a scalable, enterprise-grade baseline.

# SYSTEM REPORT GOVERNANCE EFFECT

This System Report standard ensures:

## For LLM Systems

LLMs MUST:

- Follow this structure when generating System Reports.
- Never introduce normative rules.
- Always reference DESIGN.md as authority.

## For Automated Test Systems

Test systems MUST:

- Validate report structure.
- Reject normative statements.
- Detect DESIGN.md deviations.

## For Auditors

Auditors MUST:

- Treat this document as descriptive only.
- Use it for compliance comparison.

## For Human Maintainers

Humans MUST:

- Use this report to understand system reality.
- Never use it as design authority.

## For Governance

This document prevents:

- Rule dilution
- Architecture drift
- LLM hallucinated governance
