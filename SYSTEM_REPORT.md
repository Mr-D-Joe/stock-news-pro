Frontend (React/Tauri) & Mock Services

## 1. Executive Summary

**Purpose:**
Stock News Pro is a desktop-native financial analytics dashboard designed to assist investors in analyzing stock market data, news sentiment, and AI-generated essays. It focuses on speed, offline-first capabilities (via potential caching), and a strictly defined user interface.

**High-Level Architecture:**
The system is built as a single-page application (SPA) using **React (Vite)** and **TypeScript**, packaged as a native desktop application using **Tauri**. It currently operates on a **Mock Service Layer** (`MockApiService`) that simulates complex backend operations (data retrieval, deep web analysis, LLM generation) with determinism and controlled latency.

**Current Maturity Level:**
**High-Fidelity Prototype / MVP**.
The application is functionally complete for demonstration purposes with robust error handling and mock data. It is *not* connected to live market data APIs or real LLMs.

## 2. System Architecture

**Architecture Style:**
Component-Based Monolithic SPA (Single Page Application).

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **Presentation Layer (Components):** Pure UI components with minimal logic (e.g., `TopBar`, `EventMonitorCard`).
- **State Management (Context):** `AppContext` acts as the single source of truth, managing global state (selected stock, sector, language) and caching.
- **Service Layer:** `MockApiService` encapsulates all external data simulations. Components *never* call APIs directly, they go through Context or hooks.
- **Native Bridge:** Tauri is used for the native shell but is currently largely passive (hosting the webview).

**Technology Stack:**
- **Core:** React 19, TypeScript ~5.9
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7.3
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4 (with utility libraries `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`)
- **Desktop Shell:** Tauri v2 (Rust-based)
- **Visualization:** Recharts 3.6
- **Icons:** Lucide React

**Boundaries:**
- **Backend:** does not exist. All logic is client-side mock.
- **AI:** Simulated via static template generation in `MockApiService`.

**Strengths:**
- **Data Flow Clarity:** Unidirectional data flow via Context.
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering with client-side caching (`Map<string, AnalysisResult>`).
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript interfaces (`types.ts`) prevent data mismatches.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Mock Coupling:** The application is tightly coupled to the shape of the Mock Service. Transitioning to real APIs will require a significant rewrite of the `MockApiService` implementation (though interface can remain).

### 3. Module Overview
Note: Detailed module analysis intentionally omitted in this snapshot.

## 10. Final Assessment

**Is the system internally consistent?** Yes.  
**Is it extendable?** Yes, the Component/Service separation is clean.  
**Is it production-ready?** **No**. It is a "Production-Grade Prototype".

**Verdict:** The system is an excellent baseline foundation. The migration to React/Tauri was successful, resulting in a performant, strictly typed, and aesthetically professional application.
